Quick Alarm
---

Have you ever been annoyed by how terrible stock alarm apps are?

First, you need to open Clock app, 
then open the Alarm tab,
then press a small plus button to open the new alarm dialog,
then pick the time you want,
then pick days of the week that you want it ring on,
then uncheck 'repeat weekly' checkbox,
and then press 'Done'.
And you need to close the whole app to get where you were before doing this.

This is stupid.

Now, it's never been quicker to set an alarm that you really need with Quick Alarm.
Just pick time and press the button. That's all. The app even closes itself afterwards.

Compatibility: Android 5.0+
